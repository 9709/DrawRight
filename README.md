# DrawRight

### Overview 

DrawRight is a turn based, two player cooperative game, that is played on the same device.  

Both players are given one subject to draw towards, and each player can only draw one side of the provided subject.  
The catch is neither player should know what each other drew.  There will be indicators on screen 
where the first player will have to draw into.  Anything drawn within the indicators will be seen by the second player, 
as the screen will pan over and cover whatever the first player has drawn.  
Each turns are timed, so both players will only have a limited time to complete their half of the drawing.  

Finally, both halves of the drawing will merge, and the work will be presented.  There will also be an option to save the final drawing to your iPhone Photo Library.

DrawRight is designed to be a quick pick-up and play type of game.  Ideal for ice breaker events, parties, 
team building or simply playing on the bus.
